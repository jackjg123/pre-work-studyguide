        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.
             It is made up of elements which work together to 
             provide content </br>and the basic framework for all pages 
             on the web.
            </li>

          <li>The following element types are commonly used to add 
            content to pages: Text elements, Image elements, </br>Header 
            elements, List elements
          </li>

          <li>Here are some common element types that are used to 
            divide and describe a page: Meta-related elements, Content
          </br>division elements, Semantic elements.
          </li>

          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, 
            that helps the browser to render the page correctly. 
            Elements </br>included within the head are not visible when a 
            user looks at a webpage.
          </li>

          <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user.
            All the elements that we want the user to see and </br>interact with 
            must be placed inside this element.
          </li>

          <li> An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>

          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively 
            serve our webpage to users.
          </li>
          
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          
          <li>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the 
            ranking of a website in search engines such as </br>Google or Bing. Better 
            SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.
          </li>

          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.
          </li>

          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage
          </li>

          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.
          </li>

          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, 
            description, keywords, author, and viewport.
          </li>

          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          
          <li>The charset element sets our character encoding.</li>

          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          
          <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          
          <li> In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes 
            its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
          <li>a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>\

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep 
            track of each version of your project. To access </br>Git, we use 
            the command line.
          </li>

          <li>Git commands always start with git.</li>

          <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo,
            add our code to the repo, and view the different </br>versions 
            of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit. 
          </li>

          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own 
            computer, but to collaborate with others, you need </br>to 
            use another tool, GitHub.
          </li>

          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows 
            us to keep track of our projects inside repositories 
          </br>that are stored remotely.
          </li>

          <li>Markdown is a lightweight plain-text formatting language.</li>

          <li>GitHub issues are often formatted with a language called Markdown.</li>
