# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description
My motivation for creating the Prework-Study-Guide application arises from my eagerness to learn code. I'm learning code for a future career, challenge, and to help other people. I built this project to store everything I have learned about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript into a single, easily accessable resource. It helps the user to  simply access necessary infromation for a beginner in code. the Prework=study-guide provides a multitude of CSS, HTML, Git, and JavaScript facts one one page. I learned many new and useful ways to project thoughts and ideas onto a webpage.
